# ruby-syntax

The goal is for the basic syntax to become second nature.

For each exercise, open a blank editor and save it, i.e. exercise1.rb
The goal is to be able to write the code from scratch
You will probably need to google at first, that's ok!
However, keep repeating the exercise in a blank editor until you can nail it from scratch
Run the code in the terminal with:
ruby loops_and_methods/exercise1.rb
node loops_and_methods/exercise1.js

Check the output against the expected output

For each exercise, start only with this list of names:

```
names = [
  "Sophia",
  "Noah",
  "Jackson",
  "Emma",
  "Mia",
  "Carter"
]
```
